## 👋 About Me

Hello! I’m **Trinh Nguyen Mai**, a **data analyst** who thrives at the intersection of business understanding and technical expertise. I am currently a final-year student at the **University of Economics and Laws (VNU-HCM)**, pursuing a **Bachelor’s degree in Management of Information Systems**, expected to graduate in **May 2025**.

I specialize in building **data-driven solutions** that improve decision-making and business performance. With hands-on experience using **Power BI, SQL, Python, and R**, I design robust dashboards, optimize data pipelines, and develop machine learning models that uncover actionable insights.

As someone who's passionate about **problem-solving, automation, and continuous learning**, I’ve worked in cross-functional teams to support product optimization, fraud detection, and performance tracking. My goal is to contribute to high-impact analytics teams—like at MoMo or other tech-forward companies—by combining analytical rigor with a user-focused mindset.
