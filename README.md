## Projects

Below are some of the most notable projects I have worked on, demonstrating my abilities in data analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence.

### 1. **Fraud Detection with Machine Learning**
- **Tools Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SQL
- **Description**: In this project, I developed and trained machine learning models to identify fraudulent transactions in financial datasets. I used models like **Logistic Regression**, **XGBoost**, and **Random Forest** to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. My solution achieved a **98% recall** and **95% precision**, enhancing security and reducing false positives.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
  - Model training and hyperparameter tuning
  - Evaluation and performance assessment of models
  - Deployed a fraud detection system for real-time usage.

### 2. **Customer Segmentation Analysis**
- **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, K-Means), SQL
- **Description**: For this project, I analyzed customer data to group similar customers using **K-Means clustering**. By segmenting customers based on their purchasing behaviors, I was able to provide actionable insights to improve marketing strategies and customer retention.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Cleaned and preprocessed customer data
  - Applied clustering techniques to segment customers
  - Visualized segmentation results using matplotlib and seaborn
  - Provided recommendations based on insights for targeted marketing.

### 3. **Power BI Dashboards for HR Analytics**
- **Tools Used**: Power BI, SQL
- **Description**: Developed interactive **Power BI dashboards** to visualize key HR metrics such as employee performance, turnover rates, and recruitment progress. The dashboard helped HR teams quickly assess trends and make informed decisions related to staffing and retention.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Designed and implemented multiple dashboards for HR tracking
  - Integrated data from SQL Server to automate the reporting process
  - Created custom KPIs to measure HR effectiveness
  - Enhanced user experience with dynamic filters and drill-down features.

### 4. **Data Cleaning and ETL Processes for Business Intelligence**
- **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas), SQL, Power BI
- **Description**: This project involved designing and optimizing **ETL pipelines** to clean and process raw data from various sources for analysis. I used **Python** and **SQL** to transform the data into a usable format and then created reports and dashboards in **Power BI** to track business performance.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Cleaned raw datasets, handled missing values, and removed duplicates
  - Built ETL pipelines to automate data flow from databases to dashboards
  - Optimized SQL queries to reduce data retrieval times
  - Delivered actionable reports for business stakeholders.
