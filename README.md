### 🔹 Customer Segmentation and Retention Analysis using RFM Model & K-Means Clustering

This project performs **customer segmentation** and **retention analysis** using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** model and **K-Means clustering**. The goal of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and to evaluate customer retention using **Cohort Analysis**. By segmenting customers effectively, we can derive actionable insights that help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer retention.

**Project Overview**:  
In this project, I used the RFM model to segment customers into distinct groups based on their:
- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency**: How often a customer makes a purchase.
- **Monetary**: How much money a customer spends.

The **K-Means clustering** algorithm was used to group customers with similar behaviors into segments. Following the segmentation, **Cohort Analysis** was conducted to evaluate how different customer segments retain over time. The results of this analysis were used to provide recommendations on improving customer retention strategies.

**Key Features**:
- **Customer Segmentation**: Using RFM metrics, customers were categorized into groups such as high-value loyal customers, at-risk customers, and frequent low-value customers.
- **Cohort Analysis**: Evaluated customer retention over time to understand how different customer groups interacted with the brand.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provided recommendations for targeted marketing strategies to enhance customer retention based on identified segments.

**Tools & Technologies**:  
- **Python**: Main programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing K-Means clustering.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and results display.

**Steps Involved**:
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed customer transaction data to prepare it for analysis.
2. **RFM Model Application**: Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer.
3. **Clustering using K-Means**: Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their RFM values.
4. **Cohort Analysis**: Performed Cohort analysis to understand customer retention across different segments.
5. **Insights & Recommendations**: Derived insights and provided actionable recommendations for marketing strategies.

**Results**:
- **Segmentation**: Segmented customers into high-value, loyal, and at-risk groups based on their purchasing behavior.
- **Retention Rates**: Evaluated customer retention rates through cohort analysis and identified opportunities for improving retention strategies.
- **Marketing Recommendations**: Suggested personalized marketing strategies for each customer segment to increase retention and enhance long-term value.
